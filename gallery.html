        <h1>The Student's Eclipse</h1>
          <p>These photos are taken from the solar eclipse on May 8th. They are focused on the students that gathered in the Quad to watch the eclipse together. Students ran around downtown to find glasses and were all rushed to get to somewhere that they could watch the eclipse. All of the students on the Quad were silent in the moments leading up to the eclipse and started clapping and cheering when it was at the time of Columbiaâ€™s totality. </p>
